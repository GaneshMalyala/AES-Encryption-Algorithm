# AES-Encryption-Algorithm
AES-Encryption-Algorithm  We all know that as per the prevailing trend, Advanced Encryption standard (AES) is the latest and most widely used encryption algorithm. Almost every security audit recommends using the AES for the encryption purpose. This is because the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES) that was used earlier became too vulnerable to brute-force attacks. So the purpose of this repository is to explain the Advanced Encryption standard. Please refer the uploaded file "AES Encryption Algorithm.pdf" for the detailed explanation of AES Algorithm in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.
